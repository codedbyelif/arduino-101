## Bluetooth-Based RGB LED Control

In this example, you will receive data sent through a Bluetooth module and control the color of an RGB LED.
RGB is a term formed by combining the initials of Red, Green, and Blue. An RGB LED is a component that contains three LEDs of the primary colors. By supplying different voltages to each internal LED, you can create a wide range of color combinations.

There are two types of RGB LEDs: common anode and common cathode.

A common anode RGB LED is created by connecting the positive pins of the three internal LEDs together.

A common cathode RGB LED is created by connecting their negative pins together.

In this example, a common anode RGB LED is used.
