## Making a Parking Sensor with an Ultrasonic Sensor
In this ultrasonic sensor project, you will be introduced to a new application model.
The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor has metal components that can send and detect sound waves. After the sensor sends out a sound pulse, the sound reflects back to the sensor if there is any object or obstacle in front of it. The receiver detects the reflected signal and can make a measurement.

To calculate the distance, the time between the moment the sound is sent and the moment it is received is measured. Since we know the speed of sound in air, we can calculate the total distance based on time and speed.
