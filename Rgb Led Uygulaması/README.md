## RGB LED Application 
In this application, we want to illuminate not only full-brightness colors but also intermediate colors. To set the LED to the desired brightness level, we need to use PWM. Since some Arduino pins (3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11) have PWM capability, we will make sure to use these pins when making our connections.
