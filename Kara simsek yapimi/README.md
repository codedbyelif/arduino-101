## Arduino Knight Rider Application 
In this project, you will see how the “for” loop is used in Arduino.
A for loop can be used for sequential operations.
To light up the 6 LEDs used in this application, you need to set each one as an output and turn them on in order. This can easily be done using the output configuration and LED control commands you have learned earlier.

If you wanted to modify the code without using a for loop, you would have to manually change each line one by one.
However, with a for loop, both understanding and writing the code become much faster and more efficient.
