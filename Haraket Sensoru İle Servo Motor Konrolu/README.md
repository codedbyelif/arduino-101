## Motion Sensor–Based Servo Motor Control
In this example, you will use a motion sensor to create a system in which the servo motor moves whenever motion is detected in the environment.
The motion sensor operates by detecting infrared (IR) light waves in its surroundings. All objects naturally emit infrared waves due to heat, and the sensor identifies changes in these emitted IR waves, generating an output signal accordingly.

In this example code, you will read the data coming from the motion detector and make the servo motor move whenever motion is detected.
